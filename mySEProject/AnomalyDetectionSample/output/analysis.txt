------------------------------
Remarks:

Anomaly detection results:
False Negative rate
FNR = FN / (FN + TP)

where FN is the number of false negatives (i.e., the number of true anomalies incorrectly identified as normal), and TP is the number of true positives (i.e., the number of true anomalies correctly identified as anomalies).

False Positive rate
FPR = FP / (FP + TN)

where FP is the number of false positives (i.e., the number of normal observations incorrectly identified as anomalies) and TN is the number of true negatives (i.e., the number of normal observations correctly identified as normal).

Please note that anything outside (45,55) range is to be considered anomaly.
